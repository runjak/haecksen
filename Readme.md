# haecksen

Code for [haecksen.runjak.codes](https://haecksen.runjak.codes/).

A collection of notes made in context of meetings done with the [haecksen at dezentrale](https://dezentrale.space/events/haecksen/).

## Project perspective

Fiona just created this because she wanted it to exist.

Perspective wise it could be cool to develop this into more of a shared resource that could live under a different domain.

Maybe it'd be cool to move the project to [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) and host it with [grebedoc](https://grebedoc.dev/). Github was just a quick start.

## Tech stack

This project builds on [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [astro](https://astro.build/).
