# haecksathon #1

Opening notes

-v-

Hi 👋🙂

It's so cool you've made it here.

-v-

## Disclaimer

None of this is written in stone.

It is your time, and this is just what I came up with some days ago.

---

## What's happening

- Small introduction
- More steps

---

## Reinforcing the mindset

-v-

### We don't do that here

We do not trash-talk or devalue other

- Communities
- Tools / tech choices
- Programming languages

-v-

#### Example 1

- Fiona doesn't like LLMs (that AI thingy)
  - It is still a valid choice for you.
  - She cares more that you feel safe to learn and ask questions instead of what tools you use.

-v-

#### Example 2

- Fiona thinks some programming languages are 'better' than others.
  - She will not tell you to use a specific one over another outside suggestions.
  - If you enjoy using some PL it's a good pick.

-v-

### We do that here

- If you're here you belong.
- What we do/know/learn are the right things to do today
- We help each other when we're stuck
- We ask all the questions
- We value collaboration over top-down knowledge transfer

---

## Suggested topic

Let's build a website

- Fast feedback
- Smallish steps

-v-

1. Create a `.html` file and view it
  - Explore HTML and CSS
2. Get to know git and use it to share files
  - Optionally: publish the site somewhere
3. Complicate it
  - Explore a static site generator like [Astro](https://astro.build/)
  - Get into this JavaScript thing

## Suggested agenda

- We group up and fiddle
- We take a break
- We fiddle some more
- Check-in after the break
