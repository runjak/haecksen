# haecksathon #1

Getting started: we make our first haecksathon and hope to get the ball rolling.

Let's see where everyone's at and get our feet wet with some first steps.

## Agenda

- `14:00`: People gather and settle a little
- `14:30`: [Opening talk](/slides/haecksathon-1/)
- Outline of what we'll build
  - Other options are fine
- Let's work together in groups
- Let's do a break to check-in at some point
- Let's do a wrap-up at the end

## Activity

What happened?

- A small group of 4 people gathered.
- We went through the slides together.
- We created a simple single-file `.html` page.
  - We explored the base structure of HTML and a little CSS.
- We discussed git on a rough, conceptual level.
- We played [flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).
- We had a break, some nice chats and general exchange.

## Next steps

Things that would make sense for the future:

- We should spend some time getting to know git.
  - This could enable collaboration on this website.
    - Repo is here: [github.com/runjak/haecksen](https://github.com/runjak/haecksen)
- We should spend some more time with CSS and Flexbox.
  - People would like to build a page with a menu.
