# haecksathon #2

We're looking into git this session.

## Agenda

- 30 Minutes time to gather.
- Slides on git
  - What is git for? Why do people use it?
  - Concepts: repos, commits, branches?
  - Lovis offered to prepare and hold this talk
- Open questions?
- Let's get to know git.

## Ideas

### Oh my git

The git learning game by Bleeptrack and Blinry could be of value:

- [blinry.org/git-game/](https://blinry.org/git-game/)
- [github.com/git-learning-game/oh-my-git](https://github.com/git-learning-game/oh-my-git)

### Install sessions

Let's aid people in installing and setting up git.

It could be cool to have a shared repo to work with.

## Goals

Suggested goals to aid expectations:

- Form a shared understanding of git
  - Through a talk
  - Through discussion
- Have git installed
- Have an idea of what git is
- Have created a local Repo
- Have created with some remote platform
- Have committed something
- Have pushed/pulled some changes
- Have merged some changes
