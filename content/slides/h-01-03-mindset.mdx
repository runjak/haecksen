## Reinforcing the mindset
</section>

<section>
### We don't do that here

We do not trash-talk or devalue other

- Communities
- Tools / tech choices
- Programming languages
</section>

<section>
#### Example 1

- Fiona doesn't like LLMs (that AI thingy)
  - It is still a valid choice for you.
  - She cares more that you feel safe to learn and ask questions instead of what tools you use.
</section>

<section>
#### Example 2

- Fiona thinks some programming languages are 'better' than others.
  - She will not tell you to use a specific one over another outside suggestions.
  - If you enjoy using some PL it's a good pick.
</section>

<section>
### We do that here

- If you're here you belong.
- What we do/know/learn are the right things to do today
- We help each other when we're stuck
- We ask all the questions
- We value collaboration over top-down knowledge transfer
